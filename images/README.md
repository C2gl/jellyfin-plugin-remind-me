# Plugin Logo Placeholder

Add a 512x512 PNG logo here named "logo.png" for the plugin repository.

The logo should represent the "Next in Series" concept - perhaps:
- An arrow pointing to the next item
- Film reels or movie symbols
- A "play next" button design
- Series/sequence visualization

For now, Jellyfin will use a default plugin icon.
